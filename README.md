# 📌 Project Overview

This mobile application enables users to capture an image of an object, recognize it using AI, and receive relevant recommendations based on the recognized object. For example, capturing a book provides recommendations for similar books.

# 🚀 Features

📷 Image Capture: Take photos using the device camera.

🧠 AI-Powered Object Recognition: Identifies objects in the image using a trained machine learning model.

🎯 Personalized Recommendations: Suggests relevant items based on the recognized object.

🌐 Backend Integration: Communicates with a backend server to process images and fetch recommendations.
